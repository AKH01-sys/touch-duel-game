  - Optional penalty mode for incorrect touches
  - Countdown timer and automatic game end
  - Score updates and winner detection
  - Sound effects on dot tap, penalty, and end of game

# Touch Duel: Reflex Rush - Updates

## Latest Updates

### Game Settings Improvements
- Added more time options: 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 seconds
- Added a custom time option allowing players to set specific game duration (5-300 seconds)
- Added screen orientation selection to switch between Left/Right (landscape) and Up/Down (portrait) layouts

### Gameplay Improvements
- Fixed dot placement to ensure dots never appear too close to the dividing line
  - This prevents accidental penalties when players try to touch dots near the boundary
  - Implemented a "safe zone" buffer around the dividing line where dots won't appear

### Layout Considerations
- Added orientation options considering mobile device usage:
  - Portrait mode (Up/Down): Better for single-handed play on taller screens
  - Landscape mode (Left/Right): Better for two players sitting side by side

### Technical Notes
- The dot placement algorithm now includes a minimum distance from the boundary
- In penalty mode, this prevents unfair penalties due to players accidentally touching the opposing area

---

## Latest Bugfix Update

### Dot Placement Fix
- Implemented buffer zone for dot placement to prevent partial circles at boundaries
- Dots now always appear completely within their player zone, with a minimum distance from the dividing line
- Buffer size equal to dot radius (25px)
- Fixed for both horizontal and vertical screen orientations
- This fixes the issue where players might receive unfair penalties when trying to touch dots that appear partially along the dividing line

### Technical Implementation
- Modified `getRandomPosition()` function to respect boundary constraints
- Added orientation awareness to the dot placement algorithm
- Improved code to handle both left/right and up/down layouts

---

## Latest Update - v1.2

### Game Duration Simplification
- Reduced game duration options to just four choices:
  - 10 seconds
  - 30 seconds (default)
  - 45 seconds
  - Custom duration (5-300 seconds)
- Removed redundant options (15, 60, 90 seconds) for cleaner UI

### Screen Orientation Implementation
- Added functional vertical/horizontal layout switching
- Orientation changes now properly affect:
  - Game screen layout (up/down vs left/right split)
  - Dot placement calculations
  - Score position adjustments
  - Border styling between player zones

### Technical Changes
- Modified game screen CSS to support both orientations
- Updated dot positioning algorithm to respect current orientation
- Added orientation class handling in startGame()
- Improved boundary calculations for dot placement in both layouts

---

## Latest Update - v1.3

### Portrait Mode Fixes
- Fixed vertical orientation (portrait mode) implementation:
  - Corrected player zone heights to ensure 50/50 split in portrait mode
  - Adjusted dot positioning algorithm to work correctly in both orientations
  - Fixed border styling and score positioning in portrait mode

### Sound Effects Improvements
- Enhanced sound effect handling to better manage playback:
  - Added unified sound playing function with improved error handling
  - Better handling of autoplay restrictions imposed by browsers
  - Improved error messaging for debugging sound issues

### Technical Changes
- Refactored getRandomPosition() function to better handle orientation differences
- Fixed dot positioning to ensure dots appear in correct positions in both layouts
- Added detailed error logging for audio playback issues
- Simplified sound playing code with a dedicated helper function

### Audio File Reminder
Please ensure you have the following audio files in the `/audio/` folder:
- `tap.mp3` - Played when a dot is successfully tapped
- `error.mp3` - Played on timeout or penalty
- `end.mp3` - Played when the game ends

---

## Latest Update - v1.4 (Critical Fixes)

### Vertical Mode Overhaul
- Completely reworked the vertical orientation mode:
  - Fixed player zone height calculations to ensure proper 50/50 split
  - Fixed dot positioning algorithm for vertical layout
  - Improved border handling between player zones
  - Ensured consistent transform behavior in both orientations

### Sound Effects Bug Fixes
- Fixed critical issues with error sounds playing incorrectly:
  - Added sound debouncing to prevent multiple play calls
  - Improved timeout handling to prevent double playing
  - Added condition checks before playing sounds
  - Force option for crucial sound events
  
### Technical Changes
- Refactored dot positioning with improved math for more accurate placement
  - Using Math.floor for integer pixel values
  - Better calculation of available space
- Added timeout reference tracking to prevent timing conflicts
- Fixed CSS flex properties in vertical layout
- Added explicit transform rules for both layout modes

---

## Latest Update - v1.5 (Sound Fixes)

### Sound Effects Optimization
- Removed error sound from dot timeouts:
  - Error sound no longer plays when dots organically disappear
  - Error sound is now only used for actual penalties in penalty mode
  - This eliminates unintended audio confusion during regular gameplay
  
### Technical Changes
- Simplified the sound management in the game logic
- Dot timeout sound feedback now relies on visual cues only
- Maintained audio feedback for important game events (successful taps, penalties, game end)

---

## Latest Update - v1.6 (GitHub Publication)

### GitHub Repository
- Game published to GitHub:
  - Created public repository for easier access and sharing
  - Added proper README documentation
  - Set up .gitignore for proper repository maintenance
  - Code now available for community contributions and feedback
  
### Technical Changes
- Organized file structure for better repository navigation
- Added full documentation in README.md
- Ensured all assets are properly referenced for GitHub Pages deployment
- Added license information for open-source distribution
