# Touch Duel: Reflex Rush - Updates

## Latest Updates

### Game Settings Improvements
- Added more time options: 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 seconds
- Added a custom time option allowing players to set specific game duration (5-300 seconds)
- Added screen orientation selection to switch between Left/Right (landscape) and Up/Down (portrait) layouts

### Gameplay Improvements
- Fixed dot placement to ensure dots never appear too close to the dividing line
  - This prevents accidental penalties when players try to touch dots near the boundary
  - Implemented a "safe zone" buffer around the dividing line where dots won't appear

### Layout Considerations
- Added orientation options considering mobile device usage:
  - Portrait mode (Up/Down): Better for single-handed play on taller screens
  - Landscape mode (Left/Right): Better for two players sitting side by side

### Technical Notes
- The dot placement algorithm now includes a minimum distance from the boundary
- In penalty mode, this prevents unfair penalties due to players accidentally touching the opposing area

---

## Latest Bugfix Update

### Dot Placement Fix
- Implemented buffer zone for dot placement to prevent partial circles at boundaries
- Dots now always appear completely within their player zone, with a minimum distance from the dividing line
- Buffer size equal to dot radius (25px)
- Fixed for both horizontal and vertical screen orientations
- This fixes the issue where players might receive unfair penalties when trying to touch dots that appear partially along the dividing line

### Technical Implementation
- Modified `getRandomPosition()` function to respect boundary constraints
- Added orientation awareness to the dot placement algorithm
- Improved code to handle both left/right and up/down layouts

---

## Latest Update - v1.2

### Game Duration Simplification
- Reduced game duration options to just four choices:
  - 10 seconds
  - 30 seconds (default)
  - 45 seconds
  - Custom duration (5-300 seconds)
- Removed redundant options (15, 60, 90 seconds) for cleaner UI

### Screen Orientation Implementation
- Added functional vertical/horizontal layout switching
- Orientation changes now properly affect:
  - Game screen layout (up/down vs left/right split)
  - Dot placement calculations
  - Score position adjustments
  - Border styling between player zones

### Technical Changes
- Modified game screen CSS to support both orientations
- Updated dot positioning algorithm to respect current orientation
- Added orientation class handling in startGame()
- Improved boundary calculations for dot placement in both layouts

---

## Latest Update - v1.3

### Portrait Mode Fixes
- Fixed vertical orientation (portrait mode) implementation:

### Audio File Reminder
Please ensure you have the following audio files in the `/audio/` folder:
- `tap.mp3` - Played when a dot is successfully tapped
- `error.mp3` - Played on timeout or penalty
- `end.mp3` - Played when the game ends

---

---

## Latest Update - v1.5 (Sound Fixes)

### Sound Effects Optimization
